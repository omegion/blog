This is the first 10 days report of my 2nd SaaS Side Project Crawly.
<!--more-->

### Introduction
During my busy daily routine between home, university and work. I wanted to create a side project to get some
experience and also solve a problem of the developers’ world. Then, an idea pops up in my mind that I was also
struggling while I was developing my first side project. 

The problem was detecting broken links. There are many useful tools that you can use on different platforms and
languages but in every case you would need to integrate and do some codding to make it work out. I wanted to solve
this problem with Crawly without integrating or codding. Crawly has a very basic idea. It crawls a website to find
out broken internal and external links. It only needs the website address of a web application.

### What is Crawly?
Crawly is a tool that crawls your web applications to find out broken pages to help you to maintain it. Crawly has a
powerful alerting system that if any page of your project is broken, you will get a notification. Crawly also offers
you to monitor your all pages of your application in historically. Since I launched the Crawly. I have added more
features and many of them on the way.

### Launching
I like to read developers’ stories on IndieHackers. I remember that one of the developers was sharing his/her idea
about the launching of the side project. He/she said that do not wait until your project will be perfect, just launch
it as soon as you can. Literally, I did the same. I launched Crawly on ProductHunt without making it “perfect”, even
I didn’t have time to correct the typos. Launching at ProductHunt was kinda successful.
